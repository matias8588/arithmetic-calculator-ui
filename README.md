# Calculator Web Platform
This project is a Web platform that provides simple calculator functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and a random string generation) with separate costs per request. Each user has a starting credit/balance that will be deducted for each request. If the user's balance is not enough to cover the request cost, the request will be denied. The UI includes login, new operation request form, user records table with pagination, sorting, filtering, and delete option.

On the "New Operation" page, fill in the fields for the operation you want to perform and click the "Submit" button.
On the "User Records" page, you can view all your operation records, search for a specific record, sort the table, change the number of records displayed per page, and delete a record.

## Deploy 📦
I've decided to use Vercel because it has a simple Installation and Configuration flow. Vercel allows us that on every commit into `main` a new deploy runs upgrading the Site page.
